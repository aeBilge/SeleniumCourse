example:
<input type="text" class="inputtext _58mg _5dba _2ph-"
data-type="text" name="firstname" value="" aria-required="true"
placeholder="First name" aria-label="First name" id="u_3_b_cW" tabindex="0">

This is all used with .findElement(By.cssSelector()) method

CSS Locator with ID ->              #u_3_b_cW
CSS Locator with class ->           .inputtext _58mg _5dba _2ph-
CSS Locator with attribute ->       input[placeholder=‘First name’]
CSS Locator with attribute ->       input[name=‘firstname’]
CSS Locator with attribute ->       input[id=‘u_3_b_cW’]

# --> is used for IDs
. --> is used for Classes
input[class*=form] --> the '*' is used for checking if it contains ...
input[class^=form] --> the '^' is used for to see if it starts with ...
input[class$=form] --> the '$' is used for to see if it ends with ...

input[class='inputtext'] --> this is going to look for all <input> tags,
                             with "class" attribute in it and the "class"
                             attribute should be equal to 'inputtext'

example:
h1 + p                  siblings (all a tags that follow a b tag or are placed right after)
h1 ~ img                siblings (all the tags that are siblings of a tag)
img ~ img               siblings (all the tags that are equal to this are consisted)
#profile > im           children (find direct children of parent)
#profile (space) img    grandchildren (find direct grandchildren of parent)

example:
<intput type="text" class="required" />
<intput type="text" class="required" />
<intput type="text">
<intput type="radio">
<intput type="email">

...:not(...) will avoid the element in the brackets
1. input:not(.required)         ==> first 2 lines will be avoided
2. input:not([type=email])      ==> last line will be avoided

(ex: id) > (ex: tag):nth-child(ex: 2)  will select the first child with the element and tag
that has been put in the brackets, will start from top and can be NULL as well.

(ex: id) > (ex: tag):nth-last-child(ex: 2)  will select the last child with the element and
tag that has been put in the brackets, will start from bottom and can be NULL as well.
